Yes thats what I am trying to do.

WordToArt converts the input you give to attractive ASCII art using two types of characters. Currently it only supports A-Z letters and space
but you can add more letters and extend this program to use more languages, not just english. Please see the TODO for the enhancements I wish to
make and see if you can help.

You can get in touch with me at support at linuxb dot in.
