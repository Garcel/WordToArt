The current program supports letters A to Z and space. You can add new characters and numbers as well. To do so. create the art using your
favourite text editor in the file abc.txt and save it. The art must be of 8 lines long, noting more, nothing less. You can see the example
given of A. Now run the class StarCount and you will get some code that will provide the program WordToArt instructions in printing the art.
Open the file chars.dat and save the code there, along with the character that represents the code. Next time you run WordToArt, you will
be able to print the art of the letter.
